## Features

- **Create Posts**: Users can create new blog posts by providing a title, content, and an optional image.
- **Read Posts**: Users can view all published blog posts and read the full content.
- **Update Posts**: Users can edit their own posts after creation.
- **Delete Posts**: Users can delete their posts if they no longer want them published.
- **Google OAuth Login**: Users can log in to the platform using their Google account for authentication, eliminating the need for manual registration and login.
